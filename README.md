An analysis of weather data from Oahu to determine if opening a business in the region can work year-round.

## Overview of Analysis
W. Avy, our employer, has tasked us with a further analysis of weather data in Oahu to determine if a surf and ice cream shop can open all year around instead of just being a seasonal business. We are to use SQLite data, reflect it, query it, build a data frame and provide summary statistics so W. Avy can easily determine if they want to open their business.

## Results
* During June, using 1700 data points, we found the mean temperature was 74.94 degrees farenheit with the minimum sitting at 64 degrees farenheit, and the maximum being 85 degrees farenheit.

* During December, using 1514 data points, it was found that the mean temperature was 71.04 farenheit and the minimum was 56 degrees farenheit, with a december maximum being 83 degrees farenheit.

* Overall, the difference in mean temperature is only 3.9 degrees farenheit. While the minimum saw a difference of 8 degrees farenheit the max was only 2 degrees of difference. 

## Summary
It is my opinion that due to the low difference in mean temperature and such close max temperatures that an ice cream and surf shop is equally as viable in December as it is in June, if W. Avy is using June as a benchmark for viability. However, with the slightly lower temperatures in December it should be expected to sell slightly less of both products during that month. This should be accounted for in the business plan.
